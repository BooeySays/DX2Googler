	By default, the hotkey is set to [CTRL] + [K], the same search hotkey
	used by most GUI web browsers.

	Here, you can set your hotkey to any key combination you want, and you
	are NOT limited to using just a modifier and another key.

	For example, you can set your hotkey to be [CTRL] + [K] x2 (Hitting
	[CTRL]+[K] twice). To do this, simple select CONTINUE after choosing
	your hotkey, and enter another hotkey sequence.

"""Please select a modifier for your hotkey:
	[1]	[CTRL]			( Control )
	[2]	[ALT]			( Alt )
	[3]	[CTRL]+[ALT]	( Control + Alt )
